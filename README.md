# KNN_DTree_Logistic_regression
Each record of the data set represents a different case of breast cancer.Each case is described with 30 real-valued attributes:
attribute 1 represents case id, attributes 3-32 represent various physiological characteristics, and attribute 2 represents the
type (benign or malignant). 

Performed a predictive modeling analysis on this same dataset using the a) decision tree, b) the k-NN technique and 
the logistic regression technique. Using the nested cross-validation technique, to optimize the parameters of your classifiers 
in order to improve the performance of your classifiers (i.e., f1-score) as much as possible. 

Built and visualized a learning curve for the logistic regression technique

Built a fitting graph for different depths of the decision tree (visualized 
the performance for both training and test data in the same plot). 


Created an ROC curve for k-NN, decision tree, and logistic regression.
